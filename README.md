This project is a Student Registration and Records Management System built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to register student details such as name, gender, age, address, course, and date of birth. After registration, the student details are saved in the browser's sessionStorage and displayed in a table. Users can also edit the student information by selecting the Edit button for an existing record.

The application demonstrates key functionalities for handling form submissions, dynamic table rendering, and simple client-side validation. It also showcases how to manage student data using sessionStorage to persist data across different pages.
